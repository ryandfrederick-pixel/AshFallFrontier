Create these scenes in Unity (will be added by commits as .unity files once generated on a Unity-capable machine):

- Assets/_Project/Scenes/Boot.unity
  - GameObject: GameRoot (SaveSystem, GameState)
  - Load scene: Zone_AshfallFrontier additively

- Assets/_Project/World/Scenes/Zone_AshfallFrontier.unity
  - Harborwatch and Cinderpost placeholders
  - Fast travel points
  - POI markers

For now, use SampleScene.unity as a test harness:
- Add Player capsule with CharacterController + PlayerMotor
- Add Camera with ThirdPersonCamera targeting player
