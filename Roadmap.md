# Roadmap (Post-Vertical Slice)

1. Animation/juice pass (hitstop, camera shake, VFX readability).
2. More weapon skills (6–8 per archetype) + loadouts.
3. Status effects (burn/bleed/slow) + cleanse/support abilities.
4. Dungeon modifiers (keys/affixes) + replayable loop.
5. Vendor economy (gold, buy/sell, repair).
6. Map screen + POI discovery + fog-of-war.
7. More enemy factions + elite affixes.
8. Better crafting depth (quality tiers, rerolls, mats sinks).
9. Co-op (M4): host/join, revive/downed, shared dungeon instance.
10. Online multiplayer later: relay/lobbies, matchmaking, reconnect, anti-cheat considerations.
