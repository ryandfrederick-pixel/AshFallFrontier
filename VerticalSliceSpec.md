# Ashfall Frontier — Vertical Slice Spec (MVP)

**Goal:** A PC-playable vertical slice inspired by **New World** (third-person action combat + gathering/crafting), **WoW** (questing + roles + dungeon structure), and **Diablo** (loot chase + affixes).

- **Enemies (4):** melee grunt, ranged, elite, healer/support
- **Dungeon:** Riftworks Foundry — 3 encounter rooms + boss (Forgemind), end chest loot
- **Loot:** common→legendary; item level; affixes; 1–2 uniques; inventory + equipment UI
